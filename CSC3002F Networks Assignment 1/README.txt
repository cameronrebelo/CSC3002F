IMPORTANT INFO:

-This program's server and client are designed to run on windows based machines

-The password for the server is 'password'

-The desired files to run are Server.py for the server and Client.py for the client

-This program makes use of the pyodbc library to access the included MS access database
 Please make sure that you have it installed by using 'pip install pyodbc'

FOR MacOS/Linux:

Should the above still not run, then please make use of the 'Server.py' and 'Client.py' files in the
Mac/Linux folder to run the server and client.
These are modified files that remove the database functions but will be able to run on non-windows machines.
